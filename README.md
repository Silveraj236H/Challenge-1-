Brief Summary:
  
Certain undefined div classes or elements were changed to avoid redundancy and reflect proper utility.
  
Section classes created in place of certain div classes.
  
Certain div classes were removed all together as they were unnecessary.

Previosuly non-functioning "Search Engine Optimization" hyperlink has had its function restored.
  
All hyperlinks properly link to the appropriate sections of the site.
  
Style CSS has been greatly condensed and organized which has reduced bloat and redundancy. Comments have also been added to the CSS page in order to show which sections of the CSS code for their respective parts of the webpage.
